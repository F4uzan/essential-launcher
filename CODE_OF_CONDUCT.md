# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community an experience based on knowledge and technical skills for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or political views.

We want to make this project and community for the knowledgeable and technically skilled people. As such we reject any business related inquiries. We also do not accept any business-endorsed changes, or political or social debates.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming language
* Treating people with respect
* Showing people how to improve the code
* Disclosing any business related interests upfront
* Focusing on what is best for the project in technical sense

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Forcing perceptions or thoughts onto other people
* Misuse other people for one's own perceptions or thoughts
* Blaming or scrutinizing actual or perceived minorities or majorities
* Trolling, personal, political or sociological attacks
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

The project maintainer is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and is expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The project maintainer has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that he deems inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by the project maintainer.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at clemens@clemens-bartz.de. The project maintainer will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that he deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project contributors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project maintainer.
